# welcome to imi

imi came about as I started learning Japanese this Fall.

As a part of my studying, I would practice learning phrases and then break them down into the components to learn each of the words meanings. I had phrases in Japanese given to me from my friend Naoki, and then I would create the Romaji translation, and then try to break the phrase down further to get direct tranlsations of each of the other words.

imi is very simple right now. If you have any suggestions on how imi could be improved, feel free to open an issue on this project :)

if you'd like to contribute, that would be lovely.
